  <h3>Why Work Out?</h3>
  <div class="benefits">
    <p>Working out can lead to many health benefits. Aside from looking and feeling much better, it also helps with stress reduction. Engaging in regular exercise, including bodybuilding, can help reduce stress levels by releasing endorphins (feel-good hormones). Exercise is known to alleviate anxiety, improve mood, and promote overall mental well-being. These are just a few of the many benefits of bodybuilding.</p>
